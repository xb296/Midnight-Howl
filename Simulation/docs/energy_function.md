The simulation should be based on Monte-Carlo simulation, which we can change the global behaviour of language interactions by the temperature. The simulation is governed by a gloal energy function, which I **have to** experiment with. The following is a preliminary one:

J = simplicity + expressivity + robustness

simplicity   = - (sum of lengths + symbols used)
expressivity = (coverage of T) + (distinctive representation)
robustness   = - (sum of max divergence over message noise exceeding error bound)

distinctive representation = sum of messages with multiple targets exceeding tolerance

try with 25 points (5x5 grid) with 3 symbols and l_m = 3

Note: 
- the overall energy should decrease, right?
- refer to the doc generated by Gemini on the energy of languages
