# Simulation
Before implementing RL agents, analytical and simulation results are crucial for a proof-of-concept. In this sub-project, a phase diagram is disirable for showing the conditions of language emergence. 

Two parameters of the whole system are:
- size of vocabulary: v
- environment complexity: c

For a given setting (v, c), the system should be one of two possible configurations:
- grammatical structures emerged
- no grammatical structures emerged

Thus, whether a language can emerge can be determined by values of (v, c).

## Prerequisites
```shell
# install networkx
conda activate study
pip install networkx
