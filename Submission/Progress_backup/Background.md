### Non-stationary Problems

The definition of non-stationary problems is that the agent's actions can affect the environment itself. Take the Speaker as an example, the rewards does not solely depend on the action it gives (the message with the given input), but also the actions of the listener. That is, the reward function is $r = f(m, t)$, where $m$ is the message and $t$ is the target selected by the listener. 

Unlike stationary problems, such the montain car environemnt, where the valley stays in a fixed shape, and the reward is only dependent on the time steps, in this problem, what the Speaker does affect the opponent's behaviour, thus affecting the environment (the joint state).



## Referential Games

[One sentence statement.] [History.] [Obvious properties.]



### Formal Definition

Here, following the common settings of reinforcement learning, we formally define the referential game as a MDP.
